title: My Life, My Dream
category: posts

Recently I thought much about amazing moments in my life, people I loved and gave everything to, time I wasted and fucking things I got stuck into.

I want to do much things, I like playing football, I want to be a hacker, I want to program to automate my life, I want to love someone everyday, I want to be free and happy, I want to be smarter and beyond detective.

I'm too greedy. I focus on my past, I'm addicted to my beautiful and fake future. I imagined too much and thought too less, I waited too much and didn't move forword, I played too much and did nothing.

Actually I know what is my dream, I just made it too hard to be achieved cause I thought I wasn't deserved it.

I am the one who play a decisive role, not my parents, not my friends, not my collegue, not those who I loved. I was so stupid.

There's no time to regret, no time to comfort yourself. And I just want to tell myself that:

No matter what happened in your life, no matter what you are happy about or regreting about, there will always be something that never change, waiting for you to found, to hold, till sky fall and sea rise.

I don't need encourage. I'm not that good. I'm too lazy to find what I really want to do and stick to it, too coword to perform critical actions in important moment, so that I lost my love and lost much time.

Any way the past is in the past, future is just meaningless imagination. Ask questions to yourself everymorning when you wake up. Even if you are weak and still have no anwser, you still know what to do and should just focus on it.

See who you are and what you are doing. Then there is no fear in my heart.
