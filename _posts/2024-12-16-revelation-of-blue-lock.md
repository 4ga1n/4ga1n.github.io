# Revelation of Blue Lock

Recently, I have organized my life and do what I really want to do everyday. Such as reading 10 pages of book, doing ear-training, listening to English 15 minutes, I do these things every single day and try to exercise and put my things in order to keep good habits. I finish all my daily plans and this makes me think that I am gonna realize my dream. I feel that I am working harder than ever before, I feel this is the most hard-working time in my life, indeed.

But now, I have a sense of wanting to give up, just  like many times before. I gained motivation from event, a video, or some inspirational words, and then I worked hard for a while and became the before slipping back into  old ways. I didn't give up, I just gradually returned to my ordinary life.

I need to change this situation.

Fortunately, I watch a anima named Blue Lock. It's a football story that tells about a normal high school student who are trained to become extreme egoist and grow up to a very strong football player. These is truly some useful football concept that helps me improve my football skills. But the most important thing I learned is that, dream is not the most thing you want to accomplish.

Dream is the thing you do everyday, you do the most time every single day. You keep doing it for years and years until you realize it. So I don't have dream before. I truly want something, I wanted to be professional football player, I wanted to be a guitar player in a band, and I wanted to become a real hacker. But these were not my dreams, I didn't put my whole time on it, I didn't analysis how can I realize it. I even didn't have a detailed plan.

So, from now on, I will start my dream. For me, the way to keep me doing the thin I want to do, the key to put my whole life to focus on my dream, is understanding my dream. I need to break my dream down, I want to know why that is my dream, I should make it more important then anything else in my life. I should put all the other thing back and do my dream every day. Only in this way can I persist in doing it until I complete it.

Let me finish with three questions to help me focus and persist.

1. Why that is your real dream?
2. Do you spend the most time and energy on it every day?
3. Do you feel that today you are closer to your dreams than you were yesterday?
